## Branching Strategy

We follow a GitFlow-inspired branching model with the following structure:

### Main Branches

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. All releases are tagged from this branch.
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features. All feature branches merge here first.

### Supporting Branches

- **`feature/`**: New features or enhancements
  - Naming: `feature/feature-name` (e.g., `feature/real-time-scoring`)
  - Source: `develop`
  - Merge target: `develop`

- **`bugfix/`**: Bug fixes for development
  - Naming: `bugfix/issue-description` (e.g., `bugfix/websocket-reconnection`)
  - Source: `develop`
  - Merge target: `develop`

- **`hotfix/`**: Critical production fixes
  - Naming: `hotfix/critical-issue` (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
  - Source: `main`
  - Merge target: `main` and `develop`

- **`release/`**: Release preparation
  - Naming: `release/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`)
  - Source: `develop`
  - Merge target: `main` and `develop`

### Branch Protection Rules

- **`main`**: Requires pull request reviews, status checks, and up-to-date branches
- **`develop`**: Requires status checks and linear history
- Direct pushes are disabled for both main branches

## Development Process

### 1. Starting New Work

```bash
# Update local develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... development work ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add real-time score updates"

# Push branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Types

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

#### Examples

```bash
feat(mobile): add QR code scanning for room joining
fix(backend): resolve WebSocket connection timeout
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
test(scoring): add unit tests for point calculation
```

### 3. Pull Request Process

1. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use the provided PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Add descriptive title and description
   - Include screenshots/videos for UI changes

2. **Automated Checks**
   - All CI checks must pass
   - Code coverage must meet minimum threshold
   - Security scans must pass

3. **Code Review**
   - At least one approval required
   - Address all review comments
   - Ensure documentation is updated

4. **Merge Strategy**
   - Squash and merge for feature branches
   - Merge commit for release branches
   - Rebase and merge for hotfixes

### Review Guidelines

#### For Authors
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Provide clear descriptions and context
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Test changes thoroughly before requesting review

#### For Reviewers
- Review within 24 hours
- Provide constructive feedback
- Explain reasoning for requested changes
- Approve when satisfied with the changes

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflow includes:

```yaml
Trigger: Push to any branch, PR to main/develop

Jobs:
1. Lint → Code quality checks
2. Test → Unit and integration tests
3. Security → Vulnerability scanning
4. Build → Container image building
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Code Quality (Lint)
- ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Black/Flake8 for Python
- Flutter analyzer for Dart
- Markdown linting for documentation

#### 2. Testing
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- Integration tests with real services
- Mobile widget tests
- End-to-end test scenarios

#### 3. Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image security analysis
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Secret detection

#### 4. Build & Deploy
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Container registry publishing
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production

### Status Checks

All branches must pass:
- All linting checks
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Security scans with no high/critical issues
- Successful builds for all services

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Release Workflow

#### 1. Prepare Release Branch

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version numbers
# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Final testing and bug fixes

git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"
git push origin release/v1.2.0
```

#### 2. Release Testing

- Deploy to staging environment
- Execute full test suite
- Manual testing of critical features
- Performance and load testing
- Security verification

#### 3. Merge to Main

```bash
# Create PR from release/v1.2.0 to main
# After approval and merge:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

#### 4. Production Deployment

- Automated deployment triggered by tag
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Health checks and rollback procedures
- Post-deployment verification

### Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Implement fix
git commit -m "fix: address critical security vulnerability"

# Create PR to main
# After merge and tag:
# Merge to develop as well
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests
- **Scope**: Individual functions/methods
- **Tools**: Jest (JS/TS), pytest (Python), Flutter test (Dart)
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage
- **Focus**: Business logic, edge cases

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope**: Service-to-service communication
- **Tools**: Supertest, pytest with real databases
- **Environment**: Docker containers with test data
- **Focus**: API endpoints, database interactions

#### End-to-End Tests
